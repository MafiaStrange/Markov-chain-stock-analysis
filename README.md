# Markov Stock - Analysis

The program implements an algorithm that finds the percentage change in a security based on historical daily data from Yahoo Finance and visualizes the information as a time series plot in matplotlib. The program also creates a Markov chain model in which the states are bull market, bear market, and stagnant market. Using the probabilities associated with this Markov chain model, the program will model the estimated growth of the security price through a Gaussian random walk.
